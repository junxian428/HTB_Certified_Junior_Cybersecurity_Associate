<h3>Network Security</h3>

Network security is like the security system of a house, but instead of protecting your home, it protects a computer network from threats. Just as a security system guards your doors, windows, and valuables, network security safeguards the data and devices on your network, ensuring they stay safe from intruders, whether theyâ€™re external hackers or internal threats.

In simpler terms, network security is a crucial component of information security that safeguards the network and the data transmitted through it. It employs a variety of tools and techniques to detect, prevent, and defend against various security threats.

Several key elements work together to form a comprehensive protection strategy in network security. These are but not limited to:

    <tr>
      <th>Element</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Firewalls</td>
      <td>Act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, filtering traffic based on predetermined security rules.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)</td>
      <td>Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and take automated actions to detect or block potential threats.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</td>
      <td>Provide secure, encrypted connections over public networks, ensuring data privacy and integrity during transmission. For example, used by employees to connect to internal network resources.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Access control mechanisms</td>
      <td>Include authentication and authorization protocols to ensure only legitimate users can access network resources.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Encryption technologies</td>
      <td>Protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest, rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties.</td>
    </tr>
