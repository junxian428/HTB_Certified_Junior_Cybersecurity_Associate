Over time, it has become apparent that many new students who want to venture into this field often have many doubts, which is completely understandable and normal. With all you now know about Information Security, it can indeed seem overwhelming, cause confusion, or even make you question if this is truly the right path for you. Unfortunately, this fact makes the beginning much too difficult for many. You ultimately need to find answers about what is right for you, what awaits you, where to start, and so on. Everyone wants to start on the right foot, not waste time, and progress as quickly as possible.

To make this beginning as easy for you as possible, from my personal experience, I can tell you that it's broadly unimportant where you start. For the Blue Team, without knowing how a network can be attacked, you'll only partially understand how to defend and protect against it. Conversely, for the Red Team, you should know what protection and defense mechanisms exist to bypass them precisely. Experience in both expands your skill set and naturally leads you into the Purple Team.

There's no direction here that is truly "wrong". What would be wrong is choosing a direction or field just because someone else demands it. Find what appeals to you the most, something you feel drawn to. Trust your gut feeling. Choose what interests you the most and orient yourself towards what you can engage with enthusiasm.

That will be enough to determine your personal direction and metaphorically speaking, provide you a standpoint to at least make the decision which way you want to steer. You'll encounter, learn, and practice everything necessary for this direction during your studies. If it turns out to be the "wrong" direction for you, try doing the opposite of what you've been doing.

Another important point I'd like to personally emphasize is to define in detail what you're doing this for.

Is it for the salary?
The skills?
The title?
It doesn't matter. What does matter is knowing exactly why you're doing or want to do this. This will later be crucial in determining whether you've reached your goal or not. People often don't notice their own development/progress.

No matter which direction you take, you will become a very good specialist in the area where you have the most personal interest.

The secret to success lies in the quantity and quality of attention you bring to it.
If you want to accelerate your learning progress, I recommend the Learning Process module, which will present the learning process more clearly to you.

Get started and have fun!
