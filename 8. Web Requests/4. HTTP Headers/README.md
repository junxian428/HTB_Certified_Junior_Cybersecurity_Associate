<h3>HTTP Headers</h3>

We have seen examples of HTTP requests and response headers in the previous section. Such HTTP headers pass information between the client and the server. Some headers are only used with either requests or responses, while some other general headers are common to both.

Headers can have one or multiple values, appended after the header name and separated by a colon. We can divide headers into the following categories:

1. General Headers

2. Entity Headers

3. Request Headers

4. Response Headers

5. Security Headers

Let's discuss each of these categories.
