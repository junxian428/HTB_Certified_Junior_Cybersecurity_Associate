<h3>Comparison Operators</h3>

To compare specific values with each other, we need elements that are called comparison operators. The comparison operators are used to determine how the defined values will be compared. For these operators, we differentiate between:

- string operators

- integer operators

- file operators

- boolean operators

<h3>String Operators</h3>

If we compare strings, then we know what we would like to have in the corresponding value.

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>==</td>
    <td>is equal to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>!=</td>
    <td>is not equal to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;</td>
    <td>is less than in ASCII alphabetical order</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;</td>
    <td>is greater than in ASCII alphabetical order</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-z</td>
    <td>if the string is empty (null)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-n</td>
    <td>if the string is not null</td>
  </tr>
</table>
