<h3>Flow Control - Branches</h3>

As we have already seen, the branches in flow control include if-else and the case statements. We have already discussed the if-else statements in detail and know how this works. Now we will take a closer look at the case statements.

<h3>Case Statements</h3>

Case statements are also known as switch-case statements in other languages, such as C/C++ and C#. The main difference between if-else and switch-case is that if-else constructs allow us to check any boolean expression, while switch-case always compares only the variable with the exact value. Therefore, the same conditions as for if-else, such as "greater-than," are not allowed for switch-case. The syntax for the switch-case statements looks like this:
