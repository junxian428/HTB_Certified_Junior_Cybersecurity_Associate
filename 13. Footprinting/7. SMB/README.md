<h3>SMB</h3>

Server Message Block (SMB) is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network. Information exchange between different system processes can also be handled based on the SMB protocol. SMB first became available to a broader public, for example, as part of the OS/2 network operating system LAN Manager and LAN Server. Since then, the main application area of the protocol has been the Windows operating system series in particular, whose network services support SMB in a downward-compatible manner - which means that devices with newer editions can easily communicate with devices that have an older Microsoft operating system installed. With the free software project Samba, there is also a solution that enables the use of SMB in Linux and Unix distributions and thus cross-platform communication via SMB.

The SMB protocol enables the client to communicate with other participants in the same network to access files or services shared with it on the network. The other system must also have implemented the network protocol and received and processed the client request using an SMB server application. Before that, however, both parties must establish a connection, which is why they first exchange corresponding messages.

In IP networks, SMB uses TCP protocol for this purpose, which provides for a three-way handshake between client and server before a connection is finally established. The specifications of the TCP protocol also govern the subsequent transport of data. We can take a look at some examples here.

An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by Access Control Lists (ACL). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as execute, read, and full access for individual users or user groups. The ACLs are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.

<h3>Samba</h3>

As mentioned earlier, there is an alternative implementation of the SMB server called Samba, which is developed for Unix-based operating systems. Samba implements the Common Internet File System (CIFS) network protocol. CIFS is a dialect of SMB, meaning it is a specific implementation of the SMB protocol originally created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate effectively with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it is often referred to as SMB/CIFS.

However, CIFS is considered a specific version of the SMB protocol, primarily aligning with SMB version 1. When SMB commands are transmitted over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, connections typically occur over TCP ports 137, 138, and 139. In contrast, CIFS operates over TCP port 445 exclusively. There are several versions of SMB, including newer versions like SMB 2 and SMB 3, which offer improvements and are preferred in modern infrastructures, while older versions like SMB 1 (CIFS) are considered outdated but may still be used in specific environments.
