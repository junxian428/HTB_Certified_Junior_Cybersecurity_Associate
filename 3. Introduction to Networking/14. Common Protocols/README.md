<h3>Common Protocols</h3>

Internet protocols are standardized rules and guidelines defined in RFCs that specify how devices on a network should communicate with each other. They ensure that devices on a network can exchange information consistently and reliably, regardless of the hardware and software used. For devices to communicate on a network, they need to be connected through a communication channel, such as a wired or wireless connection. The devices then exchange information using a set of standardized protocols that define the format and structure of the data being transmitted. The two main types of connections used on networks are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

We need to deal with and know the different and most used protocols. As we have already learned, these protocols are the basis of all communication between our devices and computers in the networks. We have compiled below many of these protocols that we will be dealing with throughout the modules. The better we understand them, the more effectively we can work with them.
