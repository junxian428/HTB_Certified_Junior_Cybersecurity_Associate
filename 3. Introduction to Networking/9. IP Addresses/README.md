<h3>IP Addresses</h3>

Each host in the network located can be identified by the so-called Media Access Control address (MAC). This would allow data exchange within this one network. If the remote host is located in another network, knowledge of the MAC address is not enough to establish a connection. Addressing on the Internet is done via the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address, which is made up of the network address and the host address.

It does not matter whether it is a smaller network, such as a home computer network, or the entire Internet. The IP address ensures the delivery of data to the correct receiver. We can imagine the representation of MAC and IPv4 / IPv6 addresses as follows:

IPv4 / IPv6 - describes the unique postal address and district of the receiver's building.
MAC - describes the exact floor and apartment of the receiver.
It is possible for a single IP address to address multiple receivers (broadcasting) or for a device to respond to multiple IP addresses. However, it must be ensured that each IP address is assigned only once within the network.
