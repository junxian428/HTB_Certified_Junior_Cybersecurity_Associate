<h3>Subnetting</h3>

The division of an address range of IPv4 addresses into several smaller address ranges is called subnetting.

A subnet is a logical segment of a network that uses IP addresses with the same network address. We can think of a subnet as a labeled entrance on a large building corridor. For example, this could be a glass door that separates various departments of a company building. With the help of subnetting, we can create a specific subnet by ourselves or find out the following outline of the respective network:

- Network address

- Broadcast address

- First host

- Last host

- Number of hosts

Let us take the following IPv4 address and subnet mask as an example:

- IPv4 Address: 192.168.12.160

- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192

- CIDR: 192.168.12.160/26

We already know that an IP address is divided into the network part and the host part.
