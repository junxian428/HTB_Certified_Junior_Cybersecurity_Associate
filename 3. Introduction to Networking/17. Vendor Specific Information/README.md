<h3>Vendor Specific Information</h3

Cisco IOS is the operating system of Cisco network devices such as routers and switches. It provides features and services required to manage and operate network devices. This operating system comes in different versions and releases that vary in features, support, and performance. It offers several features required for the operation of modern networks, such as, but not limited to:

- Support for IPv6

- Quality of Service (QoS)

- Security features such as encryption and authentication

- Virtualization features such as Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)

- Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)

Cisco IOS can be managed in several ways, depending on the network device and hardware used. The most commonly used method is the command line interface (CLI), which can also be managed in the graphical user interface (GUI). In addition, it supports various network protocols and services required for network operations. These include:

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Routing protocols</td>
      <td>Such as OSPF and BGP are used to route data packets on a network.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Switching protocols</td>
      <td>Such as VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to configure and manage switches on a network.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Network services</td>
      <td>Such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) are used to automatically provide clients on the network with IP addresses and other network configurations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Security features</td>
      <td>Such as Access Control Lists (ACLs), which are used to control access to network resources and prevent security threats.</td>
    </tr>

In Cisco IOS, different types of passwords are used for various purposes, for example:

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Password Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>User</td>
      <td>The user password is used for logging in to Cisco IOS. It is used to restrict access to the network device and its features.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enable Password</td>
      <td>The enable password is used to enter "enable" mode. The "enable" mode is the mode where you have access to advanced functions and settings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Secret</td>
      <td>The secret is a password to secure access to certain functions and services. It is often used to restrict access to remote management tools and services.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enable Secret</td>
      <td>The enable secret is an extra-secure password used to secure access to "enable" mode, and they are stored encrypted to provide additional protection.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

We highly recommend going through the provided external resources to understand the encryption mechanics of Cisco IOS and how those are used.

The Cisco IOS devices can be configured for SSH or Telnet. So it can be accessed remotely. We can determine from the response we receive that it is indeed a Cisco IOS, as it responds with the User Access Verification message.
