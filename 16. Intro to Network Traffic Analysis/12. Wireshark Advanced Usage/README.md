<h3>Wireshark Advanced Usage</h3>

In this section, we will cover some advanced usage with Wireshark. The project developers have included many different capabilities ranging from tracking TCP conversations to cracking wireless credentials. The inclusion of many different plugins makes Wireshark one of the best traffic analysis tools.

<h3>Plugins</h3>

The analyze and statistics radials provide a plethora of plugins to run against the capture. In this section, we will work through a couple of them. We would cover all of which Wireshark offers, but sadly, it is simply not achievable in an introductory module. I urge everyone to experiment and play as we go through this journey.
