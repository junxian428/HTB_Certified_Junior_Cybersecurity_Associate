<h3>Wireshark Advanced Usage</h3>

In this section, we will cover some advanced usage with Wireshark. The project developers have included many different capabilities ranging from tracking TCP conversations to cracking wireless credentials. The inclusion of many different plugins makes Wireshark one of the best traffic analysis tools.

<h3>Plugins</h3>

The analyze and statistics radials provide a plethora of plugins to run against the capture. In this section, we will work through a couple of them. We would cover all of which Wireshark offers, but sadly, it is simply not achievable in an introductory module. I urge everyone to experiment and play as we go through this journey.

<h3>The Statistics and Analyze Tabs</h3>

The Statistics and Analyze tabs can provide us with great insight into the data we are examining. From these points, we can utilize many of the baked-in plugins Wireshark has to offer.

The plugins here can give us detailed reports about the network traffic being utilized. It can show us everything from the top talkers in our environment to specific conversations and even breakdown by IP and protocol.

<h3>Analyze</h3>

From the Analyze tab, we can utilize plugins that allow us to do things such as following TCP streams, filter on conversation types, prepare new packet filters and examine the expert info Wireshark generates about the traffic. Below are a few examples of how to use these plugins.
