<h3>Web Application Testing</h3>

Web application penetration testing is a specialized field within cybersecurity that focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web-based applications. Unlike traditional network penetration testing, web app pentesting requires a deep understanding of how web applications work, including client-server interactions, web protocols, and common web technologies. Before diving into testing methodologies, it's crucial to understand how web applications function. Web applications are programs that run on web servers and are accessed through browsers.

They typically follow a three-tier architecture:

- Presentation tier (frontend)

- Application tier (backend)

- Database tier

To become proficient in web application penetration testing, you need to be familiar with several key technologies and concepts. These include HTTP/HTTPS protocols, HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend analysis, common server-side languages like PHP, Python, or Java, and database technologies such as SQL and NoSQL. Understanding how these components interact with each other is crucial for identifying potential security weaknesses.
