<h3>Network Security Testing</h3>

Network Security Penetration Testing is a systematic process of evaluating network infrastructure security by simulating real-world attacks. Before diving into network penetration testing, it's crucial to understand basic network architecture. Networks typically consist of various components including routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and endpoints. Each of these components can potentially harbor vulnerabilities that could compromise the entire network's security. Understanding how these components interact and communicate is fundamental to conducting effective network penetration tests.

<h3>Common Network Security Vulnerabilities</h3>

Network environments frequently contain several common security vulnerabilities that attackers may attempt to exploit. Here are just a few to be conscious of:
