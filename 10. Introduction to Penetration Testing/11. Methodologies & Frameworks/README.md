<h3>Methodologies & Frameworks</h3>

When embarking on a career in penetration testing, developing a thorough understanding of the various methodologies and frameworks serves as an essential foundation for conducting well-organized and highly effective security assessments. These carefully structured approaches provide a comprehensive roadmap that ensures completeness and precision in testing procedures. By following established methodologies, security professionals can maintain consistency across their assessments, guarantee that no critical security elements are overlooked, and ensure that the entire testing process adheres to industry standards while remaining systematic, professional, and repeatable.

<h3>Core Penetration Testing Methodologies</h3>

The most widely recognized methodology in the penetration testing field is the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES). PTES provides a framework that divides the penetration testing process into seven distinct phases: Pre-engagement Interactions, Intelligence Gathering, Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post Exploitation, and Reporting.

The Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (NIST) represents a more formal approach. While not strictly a penetration testing methodology, it provides valuable guidance on security assessment planning, execution, and post-testing activities. This framework is especially relevant when working with government agencies or organizations that follow NIST guidelines.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Testing Guide is another widely adopted methodology that offers guidance for web application security testing. It provides a structured approach through four main phases: Information Gathering, Configuration and Deployment Management Testing, Identity Management Testing, and Authentication Testing. The guide contains distinct testing procedures, along with practical examples, for nearly every vulnerability seen in web applications. It is also updated continuously by the community to address emerging threats, making it a tremendously valuable resource for anyone interested in web application security.

The MITRE ATT&CK framework has become increasingly important in modern penetration testing. Unlike traditional methodologies, ATT&CK provides a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques observed in real-world attacks. Pentesters use this framework to simulate realistic threat scenarios and ensure their testing covers the full spectrum of potential attack vectors.

<h3>Choosing the Right Approach</h3>

When selecting a methodology or framework, consider the particular requirements of your penetration testing engagement. For instance, a black box test (where the tester has no prior knowledge of the target system) might require a different approach compared to a white box test (where complete system information is provided).

Most professional pentesters don't strictly adhere to a single methodology but rather combine elements from various frameworks together. This hybrid approach allows for flexibility while maintaining structure and thoroughness.

<h3> Developing Your Personal Methodology </h3>

While established frameworks provide excellent foundations, experienced penetration testers often develop their own customized methodologies, incorporating their unique experiences and lessons learned from previous engagements. Each penetration test presents different challenges and scenarios, and documenting these experiences helps build a more robust and practical methodology. Additionally, a personal methodology can be tailored to specific types of assessments or industries that a pentester frequently encounters . For example, a tester specializing in healthcare systems might develop unique procedures for handling sensitive medical data, or for complying with HIPAA requirements.

<h3> Steps to Develop Your Methodology </h3>

- Start with established frameworks as a foundation

- Learn and practice to take notes properly for yourself

- Practice and improve your problem solving approach

- Document successful techniques and approaches from each box, lab, and engagement

- Incorporate tools and scripts that have proven effective, rewrite them, and write your own

- Create custom checklists for different testing cases (web app testing, network testing, information gathering, etc.)

- Regularly update your methodology based on the experience you gain

A personal methodology should be flexible enough to adapt to different scenarios while maintaining the rigor and systematic approach necessary for professional penetration testing. It should also include clear documentation practices, helping to maintain consistency across engagements and facilitate knowledge sharing with team members.

Remember that methodology development is an iterative process. As you gain experience and encounter new challenges, your approach should evolve to incorporate new techniques, tools, and best practices. This continuous improvement ensures your methodology remains effective and relevant in the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity.
