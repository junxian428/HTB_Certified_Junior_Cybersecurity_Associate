<h3>Windows Event Logs</h3>

<h3>Windows Event Logging Basics</h3>

Windows Event Logs are an intrinsic part of the Windows Operating System, storing logs from different components of the system including the system itself, applications running on it, ETW providers, services, and others.

Windows event logging offers comprehensive logging capabilities for application errors, security events, and diagnostic information. As cybersecurity professionals, we leverage these logs extensively for analysis and intrusion detection.

The logs are categorized into different event logs, such as "Application", "System", "Security", and others, to organize events based on their source or purpose.

Event logs can be accessed using the Event Viewer application or programmatically using APIs such as the Windows Event Log API.

Accessing the Windows Event Viewer as an administrative user allows us to explore the various logs available.
