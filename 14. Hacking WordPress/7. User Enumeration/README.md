<h3>User Enumeration</h3>

Enumerating a list of valid users is a critical phase of a WordPress security assessment. Armed with this list, we may be able to guess default credentials or perform a brute force password attack. If successful, we may be able to log in to the WordPress backend as an author or even as an administrator. This access can potentially be leveraged to modify the WordPress website or even interact with the underlying web server.

There are two methods for performing manual username enumeration.

<h3>First Method</h3>

The first method is reviewing posts to uncover the ID assigned to the user and their corresponding username. If we mouse over the post author link titled "by admin," as shown in the below image, a link to the user's account appears in the web browser's lower-left corner.
