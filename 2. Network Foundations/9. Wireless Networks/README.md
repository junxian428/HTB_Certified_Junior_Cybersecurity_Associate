<h3>Wireless Networks</h3>

A wireless network is a sophisticated communication system that employs radio waves or other wireless signals to connect various devices such as computers, smartphones, and IoT gadgets, enabling them to communicate and exchange data without the need for physical cables. This technology allows devices to connect to the internet, share files, and access services seamlessly over the air, offering flexibility and convenience in personal and professional environments.

<h3>Wireless Router</h3>

A router is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks. In a home or small office setting, a wireless router combines the functions of:

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Routing</td>
    <td>Directing data to the correct destination (within your network or on the internet).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wireless Access Point</td>
    <td>Providing Wi-Fi coverage.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For example, at home, our smartphones, laptops, and smart TVs all connect wirelessly to our router. The router is plugged into a modem that brings internet service from the ISP (Internet Service Provider). Below are the main components of a wireless router.

<h3>Mobile Hotspot</h3>

A mobile hotspot allows a smartphone (or other hotspot devices) to share its cellular data connection via Wi-Fi. Other devices (laptops, tablets, etc.) then connect to this hotspot just like they would to a regular Wi-Fi network. A mobile hotspot uses cellular data, connecting devices to the internet via a cellular network, such as 4G or 5G. The range of a hotspot is typically limited to just a few meters. Running a hotspot can also significantly drain the battery of the device creating the hotspot. For security, access to the hotspot is usually protected by a password, similar to the security measures used for a home Wi-Fi network. To better understand this concept, we can imagine that we are traveling and don’t have access to public Wi-Fi. We can activate the hotspot on our phone and connect our laptop to our phone’s Wi-Fi signal to browse the internet.

<h3>Cell Tower</h3>

A cell tower (or cell site) is a structure where antennas and electronic communications equipment are placed to create a cellular network cell. This cell in a cellular network refers to the specific area of coverage provided by a single cell tower, which is designed to seamlessly connect with adjacent cells created by other towers. Each tower covers a certain geographic area, allowing mobile phones (and other cellular-enabled devices) to send and receive signals.

Cell towers function through a combination of radio transmitters and receivers, which are equipped with antennas to communicate over specific radio frequencies. These towers are managed by Base Station Controllers (BSC), which oversee the operation of multiple towers. BSCs handle the transfer of calls and data sessions from one tower to another when users move across different cells. Finally, these towers are connected to the core network via backhaul links, which are typically fiber optic or microwave links.

Cell towers are differentiated by their coverage capacities and categorized primarily into macro cells and micro/small cells. Macro cells consist of large towers that provide extensive coverage over several kilometers, making them ideal for rural areas where wide coverage is necessary. On the other hand, micro and small cells are smaller installations typically located in urban centers. These towers are placed in densely populated areas and fill the coverage gaps left by macro cells. To better understand the concept of a cellular network, imagine we are on a road trip, streaming music on the phone. As we move, our phone switches from one cell tower to the next to maintain connection.

<h3>Frequencies in Wireless Communications</h3>

As mentioned earlier, wireless communications utilize radio waves to enable devices to connect and communicate with each other. These radio waves are emitted at specific frequencies, known as oscillation rates, which are measured in hertz (Hz). Common frequency bands for wireless networks include:

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>Frequency Band</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.4 GHz (Gigahertz)</td>
    <td>Used by older Wi-Fi standards (802.11b/g/n). Better at penetrating walls, but can be more prone to interference (e.g., microwaves, Bluetooth).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 GHz</td>
    <td>Used by newer Wi-Fi standards (802.11a/n/ac/ax). Faster speeds, but shorter range.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cellular Bands</td>
    <td>For 4G (LTE) and 5G. These range from lower frequencies (700 MHz) to mid-range (2.6 GHz) and even higher frequencies for some 5G services (up to 28 GHz and beyond).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Different frequencies play crucial roles in wireless communication due to their varying characteristics and the trade-offs between range and speed. Lower frequencies tend to travel farther but are limited in the amount of data they can carry, making them suitable for broader coverage with less data demand. In contrast, higher frequencies, while capable of carrying more data, have a much shorter range. Additionally, frequency bands can get congested as many devices operate on the same frequencies, leading to interference that degrade performance. To manage and mitigate these issues, government agencies (such as the FCC in the United States) regulate frequency allocations, ensuring orderly use of the airwaves and preventing interference among users.

<h3>Summarizing</h3>

On a typical day, we might use several forms of wireless technology. At home, our wireless router provides internet access via Wi-Fi at both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies to devices like our phone and laptop. When we leave home, our phone automatically connects to the internet using the nearest cell tower over 4G or 5G networks. While traveling abroad, we can turn on our phone’s mobile hotspot to share our cellular data with a friend’s laptop. Throughout these activities, we engage with three key wireless technologies: Wi-Fi for local wireless access, cellular networks for wide-area coverage, and a mobile hotspot for personal data sharing.
