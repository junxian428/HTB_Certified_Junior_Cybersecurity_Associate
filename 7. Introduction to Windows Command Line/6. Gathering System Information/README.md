<h3>Gathering System Information</h3>

Now that we are familiar with navigating our Windows host using nothing but the Command Prompt let us move on to a fundamental concept accessible to both Systems Administrators and Penetration Testers: Gathering System Information.

Gathering system information(aka host enumeration) may seem daunting at first; however, it is a crucial step in providing a good foundation for getting to know our environment. Learning the environment and getting a general feel for our surroundings is beneficial to both sides of the aisle, benefitting the red team and the blue team. Those seated on the red team(Penetration Testers, Red Team Operators, hackers, etc.) will find value in being able to scan their hosts and the environment to learn what vulnerable services and machines can be exploited. Whereas the blue team(System Administrators, SOC Analysts, etc.) can use the information to diagnose issues, secure hosts and services, and ensure integrity across the network. Regardless of which team we might find ourselves most interested in or currently involved in, this section aims to provide the following information:

What information can we gather from the system(host)?

Why do we need this information, and what is the importance of thorough enumeration?

How do we get this information via Command Prompt, and what general methodology should we follow?
