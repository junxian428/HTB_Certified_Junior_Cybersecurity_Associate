<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>

Regular expressions (RegEx) are like the art of crafting precise blueprints for searching patterns in text or files. They allow you to find, replace, and manipulate data with incredible precision. Think of RegEx as a highly customizable filter that lets you sift through strings of text, looking for exactly what you need—whether it's analyzing data, validating input, or performing advanced search operations.

At its core, a regular expression is a sequence of characters and symbols that together form a search pattern. These patterns often involve special symbols called metacharacters, which define the structure of the search rather than representing literal text. For example, metacharacters allow you to specify whether you're searching for digits, letters, or any character that fits a certain pattern.

RegEx is available in many programming languages and tools, such as grep or sed, making it a versatile and powerful tool in a our toolkit.

<h3>Grouping</h3>

Among other things, regex offers us the possibility to group the desired search patterns. Basically, regex follows three different concepts, which are distinguished by the three different brackets:
