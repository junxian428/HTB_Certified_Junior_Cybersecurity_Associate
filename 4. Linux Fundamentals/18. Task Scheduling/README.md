<h3>Task Scheduling</h3>

Task scheduling is a critical feature in Linux systems that allows users and administrators to automate tasks by running them at specific times or regular intervals, eliminating the need for manual initiation. Available in distributions like Ubuntu, Red Hat Linux, and Solaris, this functionality manages a wide array of tasks such as automatic software updates, script execution, database maintenance, and backup automation. By scheduling regular and repetitive tasks, it ensures they are performed consistently and reliably. Additionally, alerts can be configured to notify administrators or users when certain events occur. While there are numerous applications for this type of automation, these examples represent the most common use cases.

Task scheduling in general is like setting a coffee or tea maker to brew automatically each morning. Once programmed, it prepares coffee or tea at the desired time without further intervention, ensuring a fresh cup is ready when you need it.

Understanding task scheduling in Linux systems is essential for us as cybersecurity specialists and penetration testers because it can serve both as a legitimate administrative tool and a vector for malicious activity. Knowledge of how tasks are automated allows you to identify potential security risks, such as unauthorized cron jobs that execute harmful scripts or maintain persistent backdoors at scheduled intervals. By comprehending the intricacies of task scheduling, you can detect and analyze these hidden threats, enhance system audits, and even utilize scheduled tasks to simulate attack scenarios during penetration testing.

<h3>Systemd</h3>

ystemd is a service used in Linux systems such as Ubuntu, Redhat Linux, and Solaris to start processes and scripts at a specific time. With it, we can set up processes and scripts to run at a specific time or time interval and can also specify specific events and triggers that will trigger a specific task. To do this, we need to take some steps and precautions before our scripts or processes are automatically executed by the system.

1. Create a timer (schedules when your mytimer.service should run)

2. Create a service (executes the commands or script)

3. Activate the timer

<h3>Create a Timer</h3>

To create a timer for systemd, we need to create a directory where the timer script will be stored.

@htb[/htb]$ sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/mytimer.timer.d

@htb[/htb]$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/mytimer.timer

Next, we need to create a script that configures the timer. The script must contain the following options: "Unit", "Timer" and "Install". The "Unit" option specifies a description for the timer. The "Timer" option specifies when to start the timer and when to activate it. Finally, the "Install" option specifies where to install the timer.

<h3>Mytimer.timer</h3>

[Unit]

Description=My Timer

[Timer]

OnBootSec=3min

OnUnitActiveSec=1hour

[Install]

WantedBy=timers.target

Here it depends on how we want to use our script. For example, if we want to run our script only once after the system boot, we should use OnBootSec setting in Timer. However, if we want our script to run regularly, then we should use the OnUnitActiveSec to have the system run the script at regular intervals. Next, we need to create our service.

<h3>Create a Service</h3>

@htb[/htb]$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/mytimer.service

Here we set a description and specify the full path to the script we want to run. The "multi-user.target" is the unit system that is activated when starting a normal multi-user mode. It defines the services that should be started on a normal system startup.

[Unit]

Description=My Service

[Service]

ExecStart=/full/path/to/my/script.sh

[Install]

WantedBy=multi-user.target

After that, we have to let systemd read the folders again to include the changes.

<h3>Reload Systemd</h3>

@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

After that, we can use systemctl to start the service manually and enable the autostart.

<h3>Start the Timer & Service</h3>

@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl start mytimer.timer

@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl enable mytimer.timer

This way, mytimer.service will be launched automatically according to the intervals (or delays) you set in mytimer.timer.

<h3>Cron</h3>

Cron is another tool that can be used in Linux systems to schedule and automate processes. It allows users and administrators to execute tasks at a specific time or within specific intervals. For the above examples, we can also use Cron to automate the same tasks. We just need to create a script and then tell the cron daemon to call it at a specific time.

With Cron, we can automate the same tasks, but the process for setting up the Cron daemon is a little different than Systemd. To set up the cron daemon, we need to store the tasks in a file called crontab and then tell the daemon when to run the tasks. Then we can schedule and automate the tasks by configuring the cron daemon accordingly. The structure of Cron consists of the following components:

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Time Frame</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Minutes (0-59)</td>
      <td>This specifies in which minute the task should be executed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hours (0-23)</td>
      <td>This specifies in which hour the task should be executed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Days of month (1-31)</td>
      <td>This specifies on which day of the month the task should be executed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Months (1-12)</td>
      <td>This specifies in which month the task should be executed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Days of the week (0-7)</td>
      <td>This specifies on which day of the week the task should be executed.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For example, such a crontab could look like this:

# System Update

0 _/6 _ \* \* /path/to/update_software.sh

# Execute Scripts

0 0 1 \* \* /path/to/scripts/run_scripts.sh

# Cleanup DB

0 0 \* \* 0 /path/to/scripts/clean_database.sh

# Backups

0 0 \* \* 7 /path/to/scripts/backup.sh

The first task, System Update, should be executed once every sixth hour. This is indicated by the entry 0 \*/6 in the hour column. The task is executed by the script update_software.sh, whose path is given in the last column.

The second task, Execute Scripts, is to be executed every first day of the month at midnight. This is indicated by the entries 0 and 0 in the minute and hour columns and 1 in the days-of-the-month column. The task is executed by the run_scripts.sh script, whose path is given in the last column.

The third task, Cleanup DB, is to be executed every Sunday at midnight. This is specified by the entries 0 and 0 in the minute and hour columns and 0 in the days-of-the-week column. The task is executed by the clean_database.sh script, whose path is given in the last column.

The fourth task, Backups, is to be executed every Sunday at midnight. This is indicated by the entries 0 and 0 in the minute and hour columns and 7 in the days-of-the-week column. The task is executed by the backup.sh script, whose path is given in the last column.

It is also possible to receive notifications when a task is executed successfully or unsuccessfully. In addition, we can create logs to monitor the execution of the tasks.

<h3>Systemd vs. Cron</h3>

Systemd and Cron are both tools that can be used in Linux systems to schedule and automate processes. The key difference between these two tools is how they are configured. With Systemd, you need to create a timer and services script that tells the operating system when to run the tasks. On the other hand, with Cron, you need to create a crontab file that tells the cron daemon when to run the tasks.
