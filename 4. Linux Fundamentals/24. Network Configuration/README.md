<h3>Network Configuration</h3>

As a penetration tester, one of the essential skills is configuring and managing network settings on Linux systems. Mastering this allows us to efficiently set up testing environments, manipulate network traffic, and identify or exploit vulnerabilities. A solid understanding of Linux network configuration gives us the ability to tailor our testing approach to suit specific needs, helping optimize both our testing procedures and results.

One of the primary tasks in network configuration is managing network interfaces. This involves assigning IP addresses, configuring network devices such as routers and switches, and setting up various network protocols. A deep understanding of network protocols, including TCP/IP (the core protocol suite for Internet communications), DNS (domain name resolution), DHCP (for dynamic IP address allocation), and FTP (file transfer), is critical. We must also be familiar with different types of network interfaces—whether wired or wireless—and be able to troubleshoot connectivity issues.
