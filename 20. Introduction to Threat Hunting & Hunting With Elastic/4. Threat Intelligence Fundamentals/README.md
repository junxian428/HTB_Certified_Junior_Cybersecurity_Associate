<h3>Threat Intelligence Fundamentals</h3>

<h4>Cyber Threat Intelligence Definition</h4>

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) represents a vital asset in our arsenal, providing essential insights to fortify our defenses against cyberattacks. The primary objective of our CTI team is to transition our defense strategies from merely reactive measures to a more proactive, anticipatory stance. They contribute crucial insights to our Security Operations Center (SOC).

Four fundamental principles make CTI an integral part of our cybersecurity strategy:

1. Relevance: The cyber world is awash with diverse sources of information, from social media posts and security vendor reports to shared insights from similar organizations. However, the true value of this information lies in its relevance to our organization. For instance, if there is a reported vulnerability in a software that we, or our trusted partner organizations, do not use, the urgency to implement defensive measures is naturally diminished.

2. Timeliness: Swift communication of intelligence to our defense team is crucial for the implementation of effective mitigation measures. The value of information depreciates over time - freshly discovered data is more valuable, and 'aged' indicators lose their relevance as they might no longer be used by the adversary or may have been resolved by the affected organization.

3. Actionability: Data under analysis by a CTI analyst should yield actionable insights for our defense team. If the intelligence doesn't offer clear directives for action, its value diminishes. Intelligence must be scrutinized until it yields relevant, timely, and actionable insights for our network defense. Unactionable intelligence can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of non-productive analysis, often referred to as a "self-licking ice cream cone".

4. Accuracy: Before disseminating any intelligence, it must be verified for accuracy. Incorrect indicators, misattributions, or flawed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) can result in wastage of valuable time and resources. If the accuracy of any information is uncertain, it should be labeled with a confidence indicator, ensuring that our defense team is aware of potential inaccuracies.

When these four factors synergize, the intelligence gleaned allows us to:

- Gain insights into potential adversary operations and campaigns that might be targeting our organization.

- Enrich our data pool through analysis by CTI analysts and other network defenders.

- Uncover adversary TTPs, enabling the development of effective mitigation measures and enhancing our understanding of adversary behavior.

- Provide decision-makers within our organization with pertinent information for informed, impactful decision-making related to business operations.
