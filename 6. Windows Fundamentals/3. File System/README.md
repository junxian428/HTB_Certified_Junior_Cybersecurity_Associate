<h3>File System</h3>

There are 5 types of Windows file systems: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, and exFAT. FAT12 and FAT16 are no longer used on modern Windows operating systems. We will touch upon the FAT32 and exFAT file systems for this training, but our main focus will be the NTFS file system.

FAT32 (File Allocation Table) is widely used across many types of storage devices such as USB memory sticks and SD cards but can also be used to format hard drives. The "32" in the name refers to the fact that FAT32 uses 32 bits of data for identifying data clusters on a storage device.

Pros of FAT32:

- Device compatibility - it can be used on computers, digital cameras, gaming consoles, smartphones, tablets, and more.

- Operating system cross-compatibility - It works on all Windows operating systems starting from Windows 95 and is also supported by MacOS and Linux.

Cons of FAT32:

- Can only be used with files that are less than 4GB.

- No built-in data protection or file compression features.

- Must use third-party tools for file encryption

NTFS (New Technology File System) is the default Windows file system since Windows NT 3.1. In addition to making up for the shortcomings of FAT32, NTFS also has better support for metadata and better performance due to improved data structuring.
