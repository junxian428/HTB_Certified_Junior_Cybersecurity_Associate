<h3>Interacting with the Windows Operating System</h3>

<h3>Graphical User Interface</h3>

The concept of a graphical user interface (GUI) was introduced in the late 1970s by the Xerox Palo Alto research laboratory. It was added to Apple and Microsoft operating systems to address usability concerns for everyday users that would likely have difficulty navigating the command line. Most casual Windows computer users do not ever need to interact with the operating system via the command line. As the name alludes to, a GUI provides users with an interactive point and click interface for interacting with the operating system and installed applications and services.

The introduction of the GUI opened up widespread appeal and access to computers across many demographics since users would be able to interact with their computer without having to memorize commands or know any programming language. Systems administrators commonly use GUI-based systems for administering Active Directory, configuring IIS, or interacting with databases.
