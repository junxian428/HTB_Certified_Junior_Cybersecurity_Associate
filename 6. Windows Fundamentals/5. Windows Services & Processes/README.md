<h3>Windows Services & Processes</h3>

<h3>Windows Services</h3>

Services are a major component of the Windows operating system. They allow for the creation and management of long-running processes. Windows services can be started automatically at system boot without user intervention. These services can continue to run in the background even after the user logs out of their account on the system.

Applications can also be created to install as a service, such as a network monitoring application installed on a server. Services on Windows are responsible for many functions within the Windows operating system, such as networking functions, performing system diagnostics, managing user credentials, controlling Windows updates, and more.

Windows services are managed via the Service Control Manager (SCM) system, accessible via the services.msc MMC add-in.

This add-in provides a GUI interface for interacting with and managing services and displays information about each installed service. This information includes the service Name, Description, Status, Startup Type, and the user that the service runs under.

It is also possible to query and manage services via the command line using sc.exe using PowerShell cmdlets such as Get-Service.

Service statuses can appear as Running, Stopped, or Paused, and they can be set to start manually, automatically, or on a delay at system boot. Services can also be shown in the state of Starting or Stopping if some action has triggered them to either start or stop. Windows has three categories of services: Local Services, Network Services, and System Services. Services can usually only be created, modified, and deleted by users with administrative privileges. Misconfigurations around service permissions are a common privilege escalation vector on Windows systems.

In Windows, we have some critical system services that cannot be stopped and restarted without a system restart. If we update any file or resource in use by one of these services, we must restart the system.

<h3>Processes</h3>

Processes run in the background on Windows systems. They either run automatically as part of the Windows operating system or are started by other installed applications.

Processes associated with installed applications can often be terminated without causing a severe impact on the operating system. Certain processes are critical and, if terminated, will stop certain components of the operating system from running properly. Some examples include the Windows Logon Application, System, System Idle Process, Windows Start-Up Application, Client Server Runtime, Windows Session Manager, Service Host, and Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process.

<h3>Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)</h3>

lsass.exe is the process that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows systems. When a user attempts to log on to the system, this process verifies their log on attempt and creates access tokens based on the user's permission levels. LSASS is also responsible for user account password changes. All events associated with this process (logon/logoff attempts, etc.) are logged within the Windows Security Log. LSASS is an extremely high-value target as several tools exist to extract both cleartext and hashed credentials stored in memory by this process.

<h3>Sysinternals Tools</h3>

The SysInternals Tools suite is a set of portable Windows applications that can be used to administer Windows systems (for the most part without requiring installation). The tools can be either downloaded from the Microsoft website or by loading them directly from an internet-accessible file share by typing \\live.sysinternals.com\tools into a Windows Explorer window.

For example, we can run procdump.exe directly from this share without downloading it directly to disk.

<SNIP>

The suite includes tools such as Process Explorer, an enhanced version of Task Manager, and Process Monitor, which can be used to monitor file system, registry, and network activity related to any process running on the system. Some additional tools are TCPView, which is used to monitor internet activity, and PSExec, which can be used to manage/connect to systems via the SMB protocol remotely.

These tools can be useful for penetration testers to, for example, discover interesting processes and possible privilege escalation paths as well as for lateral movement.

<h3>Task Manager</h3>

Windows Task Manager is a powerful tool for managing Windows systems. It provides information about running processes, system performance, running services, startup programs, logged-in users/logged in user processes, and services. Task Manager can be opened by right-clicking on the taskbar and selecting Task Manager, pressing ctrl + shift + Esc, pressing ctrl + alt + del and selecting Task Manager, opening the start menu and typing Task Manager, or typing taskmgr from a CMD or PowerShell console.

<h3>Process Explorer</h3>

Process Explorer is a part of the Sysinternals tool suite. This tool can show which handles and DLL processes are loaded when a program runs. Process Explorer shows a list of currently running processes, and from there, we can see what handles the process has selected in one view or the DLLs and memory-swapped files that have been loaded in another view. We can also search within the tool to show which processes tie back to a specific handle or DLL. The tool can also be used to analyze parent-child process relationships to see what child processes are spawned by an application and help troubleshoot any issues such as orphaned processed that can be left behind when a process is terminated.
