<h3>Introduction to Windows</h3>

As a penetration tester, it is important to have knowledge of a wide variety of technologies. A thorough understanding of Windows and Linux operating systems is beneficial in a wide range of assessment types. The majority of systems that we encounter during assessments, whether on-premise or in the cloud, will be based on these two operating systems. It is important to understand how to attack and defend these operating systems and how they can each be used as a platform to perform further penetration testing activities.
