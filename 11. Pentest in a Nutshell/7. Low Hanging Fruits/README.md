<h3>Low Hanging Fruits</h3>

In the context of cybersecurity and penetration testing, a "low-hanging fruit" refers to a vulnerability or misconfiguration that is relatively easy to identify, exploit, or remediate. These are often issues that require minimal effort or technical expertise to address, yet they can provide significant security benefits or, in the case of attackers, quick access to a system. Examples include unpatched software with publicly available exploits, default credentials, or exposed services with known weaknesses. The term originates from the analogy of picking fruit that is easily accessible without needing to climb high into a tree.

The primary goal of searching for low-hanging fruits is to identify initial entry points that can lead to further exploitation or remediation. These starting points often reveal dependencies, misconfigurations, or weaknesses that can be leveraged to gain deeper access or improve security. For example, exploiting a vulnerable service might provide credentials or access to internal systems, enabling lateral movement within the network.

However, the concept of what constitutes a low-hanging fruit is subjective and depends on experience. For seasoned professionals, a low-hanging fruit might be an application with a publicly released exploit that is easy to find and use. For novices, even identifying which services or applications to research requires guidance. This highlights the importance of experience in recognizing patterns, understanding common vulnerabilities, and knowing where to look for exploits.

At this point, we are jumping between the Information Gathering and the Vulnerability Assessment stage. We pick a service and do our research on it if we are not sure what exactly we are dealing with. At the same time we assess the risk of this service, looking into its security history and keeping an eye open for any publicly known vulnerabilitities.

Focusing on low-hanging fruits is critical for several reasons. First, these vulnerabilities represent the most immediate and accessible risks to an organization. Attackers often target these weaknesses because they offer a high return on investment—quick wins with minimal effort. By addressing low-hanging fruits first, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface and mitigate risks before attackers exploit them.

Second, identifying and resolving these issues builds momentum in a security program. Quick wins boost team morale, demonstrate progress, and establish a foundation for tackling more complex challenges. For penetration testers, finding low-hanging fruits provides an entry point into the target environment, enabling further exploration and deeper analysis.

<h3>Searching for Low Hanging Fruits</h3>

People often make the mistake of "zeroing-in" on a single service, trying to exploit it even before understanding the purpose of the target. It is highly recommended (especially at the beginning of your journey) to work with what you see. If you pay attention to detail throughout the information gathering stage, and do proper research to understand the information you've obtained, most problems will disappear. Problems for penetration testers usually begin when:

They didn’t pay attention (have a typo in commands, using wrong port, overlooked details)

They are overthinking/hallucinating (making things too complex, do not know what they are doing the steps for, make to quick conclusions)

Most often they experience it because of, but not limited to:

They do not know where to start (didn’t pay attention)

They do not know what to look for (didn’t pay attention)

They do not know what to do with it (didn’t pay attention)

They do not know how to do it (overthought)

They do not know why something does not work (didn’t pay attention and/or overthought)

They do not know how to make it work (didn’t pay attention and/or overthought)

<h3>Target: 10.129.12.10</h3>

Let’s pick the 10.129.12.10 target and examine TCP ports 21 and 443 first. These two TCP ports are used quite often, and is common for them misconfigured or even vulnerable to certain attacks. For now, we do not need to do anything fancy, and can just work with what we see.

sudo nmap -p21,22,443 -sV -sC 10.129.12.10

Starting Nmap 7.95 ( <https://nmap.org> ) at 2025-02-15 15:29 EST

Nmap scan report for cube-case.htb (10.129.12.10)

Host is up (0.027s latency).

From the results of the scan, we can see that Nmap discovered anonymous access for the FTP port TCP/21. Administrators might use or allow anonymous FTP login in their business infrastructure to simplify file sharing for external users, or the public (using it to distribute software updates, manuals, or open datasets.) It eliminates the need for individual user accounts, reducing management overhead, especially in scenarios where authentication isn’t critical and the data isn’t sensitive.

However, if an administrator configures the FTP server for internal use in a way that inadvertently exposes it to the public, it can lead to data exposure and unauthorized access to internal data.

So, we've now obtained several important pieces of information that we can benefit from. We see that there is a file called WordPress_Blog_Setup_Update.txt , and also know there is a user and group called john . Information like this should definitely be written down, as it may become useful to us later on.

On TCP port 443, we see a webserver using TLS/SSL with the title Cube Case . The ssl-certificate subject contains the domain name cube-case.htb , and shows that it’s using WordPress CMS with the version 6.7.2. When we visit the website https://10.129.12.10 we see a sample WordPress page. A sample page serves as an initial placeholder (like the default settings when you buy a smartphone) and can indicate several things; either it has been installed recently, or admins forgot about it and left it as it is. Incidentally, both cases can lead to breach for a business.

Now, let’s summarize what we have figured out so far:

Operating System: Ubuntu

File sharing: FTP on 21

Remote Access: SSH on 22

Web Server: WordPress 6.7.2

Domain: cube-case.htb

This is sufficient for now, as we know what types of systems we will be dealing with moving forward. WordPress has many attack vectors that require some time to assess, and this will be the part of information gathering and vulnerability assessment stages (which we will jump into shortly). So, at this moment, we will focus on the next target with the IP address 10.129.12.20.

<h3>Target: 10.129.12.20</h3>

Let’s use another scan method for this target which includes version detection and script application for the running services.

sudo nmap -p- -sV -sC 10.129.12.20 -T5 -Pn

Now, let's examine the results and write down any juicy information.

Hostname: WIN01

Operating System: Windows Server 2019 Standard (build 17763)

File sharing: SMB on 445

Remote Access: SSH on 22, RDP on 3389

Web Server: Gitea

Domain: cube-case.htb

A quick look at the web server running on TCP port 3000 will tell us more about what "Gitea" is.

First, if we do not know what this service is used for, we need to do some research on it. Then, we will figure out that Gitea is a tool that helps developers store and work on their computer code, acting central hub where teams can work together on software projects. With this tool developers can:

Save all changes: Keep track of every change made to the code and lets developers go back to older versions if needed

Helps teams to work together: Let multiple people work on the same project without getting in each other's way

Improve collaboration: Let's multiple people work on the same project without getting in each other's way

Check work quality: Make it easy for team members to review each other's work before accepting changes

Organize projects: Help track tasks, problems, and project goals

Companies need tools like Gitea, Github, or Gitlab to keep their code organized and allow their development teams to work together. But there's a catch - if it's not set up safely, it can be dangerous. Code repositories often contains sensitive information like code, settings, or even credentials.

If we visit the official documentation page of Gitea, we will see the version of the most recent release. If we compare it to the one found on our target, we will see that they are using an outdated version of Gitea. It's very likely that there is some type of vulnerability or security gap, which has since been patched in the latest version, but may be present on our target.

Summary

Let's summarize our findings from the low-hanging fruit reconnaissance of both targets:

Target 1 (10.129.12.10)

Running Ubuntu operating system

FTP service on port 21

SSH access on port 22

WordPress 6.7.2 installation

Domain: cube-case.htb

Key findings: WordPress installation may have multiple attack vectors that require further assessment.

Target 2 (10.129.12.20)

Windows Server 2019 Standard (build 17763)

Hostname: WIN01

Domain: cube-case.htb

Multiple services running:

SMB file sharing (port 445)

SSH (port 22)

RDP (port 3389)

Gitea installation (port 3000)

Key findings: Outdated Gitea installation that may contain vulnerabilities and potentially sensitive information.

Both systems have possible security gaps that we should look into more closely next. Therefore, we will start with our first target (Ubuntu Linux).
