<h3>Agreement & Preparation</h3>

Before starting a penetration test, we need a clear agreement between the testing team and the organization. This agreement/contract consists of everything that has been previously discussed, and helps everyone understand what will happen during the test. The agreement can be divided into three categories, each comprised of several important parts:

<h3>Legal</h3>

1. A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): This is a legal document that requires the testing team to keep all sensitive information private. It protects both the organization's data and the details of any security weaknesses found during testing.

2. Permission to test: This is a formal document that gives the testing team legal permission to do their work. Without it, their activities might look like illegal hacking. Usually, this comes as a signed authorization letter.

3. Contact information: The agreement lists everyone involved in the test and their roles. This includes the main contact person at the organization, the testing team, and emergency contacts. Having clear communication channels helps deal with any issues quickly.

<h3>Scope & Rules</h3>

1. A scoping questionnaire and document: These explain exactly what will be tested. The questionnaire asks about the organization's systems and goals, while the document lists which networks and applications will be tested and which ones won't be.

2. Rules of engagement (ROE): This document explains how the testing will be done. It covers things like when testing can happen, what methods can be used, and what to do if something goes wrong. For example, it might say whether testers can try to trick employees (social engineering) or if they should avoid testing during busy hours.

<h3>Contract</h3>

1. Timeline: This part shows when each phase of the test will happen, from start to finish. It includes time for preparing, testing, and writing reports. It also adds extra time for unexpected issues.

2. Responsibilities: This section outlines who is responsible for what (client & testers) during the test. It includes who will oversee the testing, who needs to be available during critical testing phases, who handles emergencies, and who is responsible for reviewing and acting on the findings.

3. Deliverables: These are the final products that will be provided to the organization after testing. This typically includes detailed reports of findings, technical documentation, and recommendations for improvements. The agreement should specify the format, level of detail, and timeline for delivering these materials.

In short, this agreement is like a roadmap that keeps everyone on track and ensures the test is done properly and legally, while protecting both the company and the testing team for such an activity. Most importantly, it helps achieve the main goal: finding and fixing security problems to better protect the organization.

<h3>Penetration Testing Assignment</h3>

As a junior penetration tester, you typically won’t send or discuss a report directly with the customer until you’ve reviewed several examples and worked on reports with guidance. Juniors usually accompany senior testers to learn from them, expand their repertoire, understand various processes and approaches, and ultimately master how to manage an engagement from start to finish.

As the senior penetration testers take care of the customer and communication, it can happen that junior penetration testers are assigned a host or even a network segment to work on independently. This allows the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a real environment and practice creating documentation. Assignments are often made verbally, but can also be made in writing. A written assignment is a more formal and serious approach, and usually comes with the expectation that you produce a report.

<h3>Preparation</h3>

Before starting any penetration test, we must set up a clean environment—typically a virtual machine. This means creating an organized workspace for each new test, ensuring that no residual data from previous tests is accidentally included. Using data or files from past tests can lead to errors and may inadvertently expose private information from other clients (cross-contamination), which we want to avoid. Moreover, having a dedicated, clean workspace allows us to conduct more effective testing, as all files, logs, results, screenshots, and notes are neatly organized and easily managed. With everything in order from the beginning, we can focus on identifying vulnerabilities and documenting our findings for the report.

The consequences of failing to maintain a clear testing environment are particularly severe when the leaked information contains dangerous or critical details. For example, if a report accidentally includes exploit code, passwords, or detailed system architecture diagrams from a previous client, the new client could use this information maliciously or negligently. Worse, if the information allows the identification of the original client (e.g., through IP addresses, domain names, or company-specific data), the breach becomes even more damaging.

Such incidents not only endanger the security of the affected organizations but also erode trust in the penetration testing process. Clients rely on testers to handle their sensitive data with the utmost care, and any failure to do so undermines the credibility of the entire industry.

While this section provides a high-level overview and reasoning of the importance of a clear testing environment, the specifics of setting up and preparing such an environment are extensive and depend on the tools, methodologies, and objectives of the penetration test. All the detailed instructions on configuring VMs, installing tools, and ensuring isolation go beyond the scope of this module. For comprehensive guidance, refer to the Setting Up Module, which covers step-by-step procedures for preparing a penetration testing environment.
